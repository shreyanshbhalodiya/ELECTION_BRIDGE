# ELECTION_BRIDGE
Pioneering Data-Driven  Civic Engagement and Intelligence


Executive Summary
Election Bridge, co-created by the visionary entrepreneurs Ackeem Evans and Jermaine Hartsfield, 
heralds a significant shift in civic engagement, tackling the communication gap between citizens 
and their government with a data-centric model. This report explores Election Bridge's 
transformative use of technology, which has redefined civic participation by harnessing advanced 
data analytics to offer deeper insights into public opinion and policy-making, thus fostering a more 
informed and responsive democratic process.
The comprehensive dataset presented captures a detailed record of Portland, Maine's city council 
orders, enriched with demographic data from users of a civic application. It provides an in-depth 
view of the legislative measures and a transparent look at the political influence behind them. 
The data was refined using advanced tools such as pandas and spaCy to extract and organize 
information from PDFs, which streamlined the dataset for analysis. Review of the 'Issue Category' 
showed a focus on education, infrastructure, safety, and the environment. User engagement data 
revealed diverse interests across demographics, guiding targeted policy development.
Methodologically, the report details the use of unsupervised learning algorithms for policy 
categorization, with Word Net outperforming other techniques in effectiveness. Geographical 
classification of policies was achieved using the Google API, which enabled a thorough 
understanding of policy distribution across Portland's neighborhoods.
The modeling phase initially deployed Naive Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest Classifier 
algorithms, which unfortunately yielded poor results. This led to a strategic shift towards K-means 
Clustering, which successfully categorized the data into five distinct clusters and provided a 
structured approach to data understanding. This adaptation in modeling strategy highlighted the 
importance of matching analysis techniques to the dataset's inherent structure.
In conclusion, despite the initial challenges with machine learning models, K-means Clustering 
has proven to be an effective alternative. Election Bridge's progression highlights the critical role 
of data analytics in advancing civic engagement. The report recommends enhancing data quality, 
filling information gaps, and re-evaluating predictive models to improve outcomes.
Looking ahead, it is suggested that further refinement of predictive models, a deeper understanding 
of user engagement patterns, and the development of an impact assessment framework for Election 
Bridge are key areas for future research. These efforts will likely contribute to the platform's 
success in promoting effective communication and informed decision-making within the civic 
landscape.
